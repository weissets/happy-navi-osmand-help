<div class="content">
<p>After you install OsmAnd for the first time, all Settings are preconfigured to their defaults. In this fashion Osmand will work offline (without internet connection), but you will have to one-time download and store one or more offline maps for the countries you need, as prompted. </p>
<p>The configuration of your map screen is available via the device&#39;s menu button, then choose &#34;Define view&#34; for the basic map layout, and from that popup window you select &#34;Configure screen&#34; to define the map appearance to your needs, and also select which functional widgets you would like to see displayed on top of your map all the time. Please note that these settings are profile dependent and can be configured differently for the default, car, bicycle and pedestrian use profile.</p>
<p>Chosing the &#34;Touring view&#34; map style under &#34;Configure screen&#34; slightly re-configures the map display itself to produce maximum possible detail and opens up some more touring options like the display of hiking symbols, display of Alpine path categories, or bike tours.</p>
<p>Some more advanced and more technical information can be found in the following HowTo articles.</p>
<p>More advanced features: The basic OsmAnd plugins are already available in the application itself, and their functionality and settings can be activated under Settings in the Plugin Manager. Some additional plugins are available as separate (additional) downloads.</p>
</div>

<div class="subtitle" id="Setting_up_.60OsmAnd.60_for_your_region">Setting up OsmAnd for your region</div>
<div class="content">
<p>Here is how you can customize OsmAnd for your particular country and language. (Please note that a complete app restart is usually required to make all changed settings take effect.)</p>

<p><b>Under Settings > General:</b></p>

<ol class="list">
<li><b>Display language:</b> Please select your language. This is the language all menus and dialogues in OsmAnd will appear in.

<li>If needed, <b>Use English names in maps</b>. This would e.g. display city and street names in Greek in latin and not in greek characters.

<li><b>Driving region:</b> The region chosen here has effect on e.g. the units of measure pre-selected (see below), the appearance of the speed limit sign shown when navigating, and selects right-hand or left-hand driving.

<li><b>Units of measure:</b> Select kilometers/meters, miles/feet, or miles/yards as desired. This affects all distance and speed displays and announcements.
</ol>

<p><b>Under Settings > Navigation:</b> (These settings must be done per User Profile!)</p>

<ol start="5" class="list">
<li><b>Voice Guidance:</b> Please prefer a <b>synthesized (tts) voice</b> over a pre-recorded voice, if possible for your language. Synthesized voices are more flexible, and can pronounce distances and times in finer steps, and pronounce street names and your waypoint names, which pre-recorded voices can not.

<li>If you select a tts voice, you need to have a respective <b>text-to-speech engine in your Android operating system</b>. These are partly included in Android, or can be installed separately. Please go to your <b>Android (device)</b> settings, find "Language and keyboard" / "Text-to-speech output", or similar. Select or install an engine, then also install the language support for the language you need, this may be an extra setting or small download.
</ol>

<p>  Please test there ("Listen to an example" or similar test button provided) if your Android tts is working ok. Then you may also test if your OsmAnd voice prompts have been selected properly by (now in OsmAmd) going to Settings / General / Osmand development / "Test voice prompts". (OsmAnd debugging plugin must be activated to see the setting).</p>
</div>

<div class="subtitle" id="How_To_Understand_Vector_and_Tile_.28Raster.29_Maps">How to understand vector and tile (raster) maps</div>
<div class="content">
<p>There are two common ways to electronically store map data, <b>"Tile maps"</b> (often also called "Raster maps") and <b>"Vector maps"</b>. </p>
 <ul class="list">
 <li> <b>Tile maps</b> are like pictures, they are created, painted ("rendered") on a server and then downloaded as tiles (squares of 256x256 pixels) to your device. If you zoom in too much you see the different pixels (blurring). On the Internet, OSM maps are most of the time represented as tile maps. 

 <li> <b>Vector Maps</b> are different. For example, a line like a highway, only the coordinates (position and shape) of the line and its meaning ("national highway") are stored in a database. Then on your device these objects are painted ("rendered") on the fly, you can see the objects being drawn. Your device software can also determines the paint styles like line thickness or colors to be used. OsmAnd is one of the very few Android applications which supports vector maps. The unique selling points of vector maps are</li>
    <ul>
    <li> They are very compact: You do not need gigabytes of map tiles on your phone or Android device. This is why you can conveniently download country map files before a trip or holiday for offline use.
    <li> You can use customized rendering-templates on the same data (as is used in our automated day/night view switching, or check out e.g. the "Touring view" or "Winter+ski" Map styles in OsmAnd).
    <li> You can zoom in and do not lose any detail by blurring
    <li> You can search vector maps for addresses contained, Points of Interets (POI), etc.
    </ul>
 </ul>
</div>

<div class="subtitle" id="How_To_Download_Data">How to download data</div>
<div class="content">

<p>There are several ways to view maps. For offline use, the default in OsmAnd, you need to pre-download your maps. The osmand native format is a compact vector format. These maps can be downloaded from within the app (Note: the free OsmAnd version is limited to 10 items) or via a PC (unlimited also for free version). </p>

<p>But if you need, OsmAnd can also handle pre-downloaded or online tile (raster) maps:</p>

<p>(1) <b>Vector maps</b> (preferred solution): You can download pre-fabricated "vector" maps in OsmAnd's native .obf format. They are very compact (about 10% compared to tiles) and allow zooming in to very high zoom levels without losing detail or resolution (see [HowToVectorTileData How to Understand Vector and Tile Maps]). A small drawback on slow devices is that zooming out to "overview" levels usually takes more time and CPU.</p>
  <ul class="list">
  <li>(1a) <b>Preferred Solution: Download prefabricated country maps directly from the app:</b> Choose Menu -> Settings -> Data for offline usage -> Download data for offline usage, and filter the long list for the country name you are looking for. Files are automatically unzipped if necessary and placed in the right /osmand folder of your device's memory card.

  <li>(1b) If needed, prefabricated vector maps could also be downloaded from our download sections via a PC. They would then need to be manually unzipped (for multipart zips: [FAQ#How_to_extract_*_.zip-1,_*_.zip-2,_*_.zip-3_files see here]), merged and transferred to your device. Try this [http://download.osmand.net/rawindexes/ link], otherwise search our forum for current links and instructions.

  <li>(1c) If we do not have the country maps you need you could, on an PC, create obf vector maps yourself with "OsmAndMapCreator".
  </ul>

<p>For (1b) or (1c), put any obf file created directly in the \osmand folder. Once done, choose menu option Settings -> Data for offline usage -> Reload offline data to be sure these data is loaded. Or exit and restart OsmAnd, which does the same refresh task.</p>

<p>The folder structure of OsmAnd data is:</p>


<xmp>
  /sdcard/osmand/    (obf map files go here)
    avnotes
    backup           (deactivated obf maps go here)
    POI
    rendering        (custom map styles go here)
    srtm             (contour line data files)
    tiles            (put prepared offline sdlitedbs here like hillshade maps. Downloaded online map tiles are stored in source/zoom sub folders.)  
    tracks           (recorded or prepared GPX files)
    voice            (navigation voices each in sub-folder, tts are the more flexible text-to-speech synthesized voices)
</xmp> 

<p>(2) <b>Map tiles</b>, which are actually images or bitmaps which you can download live or pre-download in batch fashion from an internet source are useful as "overview maps", but use an enormous amount of space on your SD card for higher zoom levels (more detailed maps). There are two ways to predownload them:</p>
  <ul class="list">
  <li>(2a) From within the OsmAnd app on your device: Choose the map you want from the list (Menu -> Define view -> Map Source, Online maps plugin needs to be enabled). Zoom to the area of interest and long-click on the map. A box appears on the map. Click on it and a context menu appears. Scroll down to Map and select the zoomlevels you want with the slider. The higher the zoom level, the more detail is available, but the more space will be needed. An estimated download size is specified. Finally click download. This is useful if you need a relatively small area and you have WiFi connection e.g. in the hotel or at home before you leave. All small tiles (separate file each) are downloaded to the tiles\source\<#level> subfolders on your device and take a lot of space! Be careful with very big area's. Some commercial map providers sometimes block your account if you download too much tiles in burst mode (Think about > 100MB).

  <li>(2b) You can also prepare tile data in sqlite database format using a PC tool like TrekBuddyAtlas (use Maverick sqlite format). This saves about 50% of storage on your SD card vs. conventional tiles, and makes access a little faster. Put these .sqlitedb file directly under /osmand/tiles.
  </ul>

<p>In any case, the OsmAnd vector format will consume A LOT less storage space on your device than using tile maps!</p>

<div class="subtitle" id="Which_types_of_maps_can_be_downloaded.3F">Which types of maps can be downloaded</div>
<div class="content">
<p>When you go to <b>Settings -> Data Management </b>, you will see that the topline "Click here to download or update offline data" is actually a link and will lead you to the <b>Download</b> screen.</p>
<p>In the top-right corner you will see a drop-down list, which defaults to <b>Regular maps</b>, but when clicking on it you see the following options:</p>
  <ul class="list">
  <li> Regular maps _(The standard maps for navigation)_
  <li> Roads-only maps  _(Absolute minimal maps only containing roads; much smaller)_
  <li> Contour lines  _(Display lines that connect points of equal height on a map; also called isolines or isopleths)_
  <li> Hillshade overlays _(Uses "shaded relief" to display a.o. hills and elevations on the map)_
  </ul>

<p>Note that you need the Contour Lines (SRTM) plugin from the Google Play Store to display contour lines and hillshades.</p>
</div>

<div class="subtitle" id="How_To_Customize_the_Map_Appearance">How to customize map appearance</div>
<div class="content">
<p>If you want to customize map view, first of all select the use profile (Car, bicycle, pedestrian) using the little selector near the lower left corner of the map screen. Some settings are profile-specific and can be set different in all profiles.</p>
<p>The configuration of your map screen is available via the device&#39;s menu button, then chose &#34;Configure screen&#34; to define the map appearance to your needs, and also select which functional widgets you would like to see displayed on top of your map all the time. Please note that these settings are profile dependent and can be configured differently for the default, car, bicycle and pedestrian use profile.</p>
<p>Choosing the &#34;Touring view&#34; map style under &#34;Configure screen&#34; slightly re-configures the map display itself to produce maximum possible details and open up some more touring options like the display of hiking symbols, display of Alpine path categories, or bike tours. </p>
</div>

<div class="subtitle" id="How_To_Arrange_Layers_and_Overlays">How To Arrange Layers and Overlays</div>
<div class="content">
<p>About layers: These can be 1. Maps and 2. Additional layers.</p>
<p>Additional layers are points or lines, like POI, route, gpx, traffic jams, transport stops and osm bugs. You can look trough them, and that is why they are referred as overlays too. All layers are accessed and can be selected and deselected via the menu &#34;Define View&#34;.</p>
<p>Maps have shapes and are almost 100% filled. Raster maps are allways 100% filled, but can be transparent themselves, like the Wanderreit hillshade map. Normally they have 0% transparency, so that is 100% opaque, Like paint, you can&#39;t look through. </p>
<p>To put raster maps on top of other maps, they can be made transparent for some percentage.</p>  
<p>Usually you have 1 map, but you can make it transparent to show an &#34;underlay&#34; map, and you can put a transparent overlay map above. So the normal map is the middle map then. Samples of underlay maps are some &#34;base maps&#34; in the layer list, as openfietskaart base map. The normal map can also be a vector map. And on top of that you can show an overlay map with some transparency (overlay transparency). On top of the three maps you can always show the additional layers.</p>
<p>So the list is from top to down:</p>
  <ol class="list">
  <li> additional layers (poi, points and lines)
  <li> overlay map. You can set transparency
  <li> vector map.100% opaque. You can set it on or off. Setting it off using settings, shows the middle map.
  <li> Raster map. You can set transparency to see the underlay map. The middle map is also the alternative map in case you are zooming out beneath the setting General -> zoom vector level.
  <li> underlay map. 100% opaque.
  </ol>
<p>The middle map or normal map can be a raster map which can have transparency, or a vector map, which can&#39;t be transparent. Actually, if you zoom out to much the vector map becomes to slow, and you can define what raster map is used then instead. The last set raster map is shown, depending on the vector zoom level. The vector map can only be the middle map, not the overlay map or the underlay map. The vector map can&#39;t be transparent, so if you want to combine it with a second map, you must set the second map as overlay map and transparency to 50% or some. </p>
<p>There are two methods to set the layers. The best way is to use the OsmAnd Main menu, which you see at start, then: settings -&#62; Map Layers. The second method is android menu button -&#62; layers. Using he layer menu you can&#39;t set transparency, but there can appear a slider to set transparency of the overlay map! Nice!</p>

<div class="subtitle" id="How_to_Find_Something_on_the_Map">How to find something on the map</div>
<div class="content">
<p>Examples: "Where am I?", where is a certain address or zip-code, where are the closest restaurants, where is the closest park, where is my car, where is what I looked for the last time. </p>
<p>Please note: to accomplish some of these tasks (locate addresses, attractions, etc.) you will need to have the offline vector map file.</p>

<p>In the Search option, there are six tabs (from left to right): </p>
  <ul class="list">
  <li> POI (Point Of Interest) search  used for finding specific places of your interest (museums, landmarks, etc)
  <li> Address search  consists of four options (Region, City, Street and Building)
  <li> Coordinates  used for finding a place via its coordinates
  <li> Favorites search  used for searching your favorite places
  <li> Search history  self-explanatory
  <li> Transportation search  self-explanatory
  </ul>

<p><b>Find your own position:</b></p>
     <ol class="list">
     <li> Enable GPS or network positioning and wait while the device discovers your position. 
     <li> Once done you will see a blue curved arrow at the right top corner. 
     <li> Click on it and the map is centered to your location, and you see a blue dot or a blue circle at center. The light blue circle around you is accuracy of the position detection. You can also enable displaying your current viewing direction (menu item Configure view), which will follow any device rotation if your device is equipped with compass sensors.
     </ol>

<p><b>Find Points of Interest (POI):</b></p>
     <ol class="list">
     <li> You need pre-loaded vector maps to be able to use this feature. 
     <li> Press the search button on the map or go through Main Menu -> Search -> Top left POI tab. 
     <li> Next select category or a predefined filter. 
     <li> Select also where you want to search: around your current position, the point currently viewed on the map, a certain other location, etc. 
     <li> After the first search is completed, you may increase the search radius to your needs. Clicking any hit facilitates the actions "Show on Map", "Set as Destination", or "Show POI description". There are also buttons to filter hits or display all hits on the map.
     </ol>

<p><b>Find an address:</b> </p>
     <ol class="list">
     <li> Press the Search button, 
     <li> long-click any position on the map and press the popup box, (or go through main menu -> Search).   
     <li> On the search screen, select the tab Address (Home icon). If you do not have a vector map file for the region in question, you can only perform an online internet search using the Internet button now. If you have an offline vector map, simply follow through the guidance by selectively filling clicking and filling the country, city, street, etc. fields. Possible choices of all hits found in your offline data will always be displayed. 
     <li> At any point you may select "Show on Map" or "Set as Destination". 
     </ol>
<p><b>Note</b>: OsmAnd autofills your search when typing, but only on cities and towns. If you type (the beginning of) a village (or smaller) and nothing is displayed, you need to press the "Search villages/postcode". </p>

<p><b>Zipcode/postcode</b>: In the city field start typing the zipcode and when done tap the "search villages/postcode" button.</p>

<p><b>Find by lat/lon coordinates:</b> </p>
     <ol class="list">
     <li> Click Menu button > Specify point, 
     <li> after that you will see the current map coordinates, 
     <li> you can copy or save them & specify other coordinates. (Please select the correct display format!!)
     </ol>

<p><b>Find Favorites</b> </p>

<p>You can use this feature to find, for example, My Home, address of a friend, etc.</p>
     <ol class="list">
     <li> first of all, mark any point on the map as favorite (via long-clicking it) or use any other possibilities where you can set locations as favorites. 
     <li> After creating favorites you can see your favorite points on the main screen under the button Favorites (sorted alphabetically by category), or on the search screen in the tab 'Favorites' (sorted by distance). 
     </ol>

<p><b>Find something in your search history:</b> </p>
     <ol class="list">
     <li> Go to the History tab on your search screen. 
     <li> You will see all search items you searched recently.
     </ol>
</div>

<div class="subtitle" id="How_To_Use_Navigation_.28Routing.29">How to use navigation (routing)</div>
<div class="content">
<p>First of all you have to select a destination, either by long-clicking on the map itself, via Search, via Contacts or some other selection mechanism. Selection on the map results in a box. Clicking this box again shows the options &#34;Set as destination&#34;. You can now choose to create a route for car, bike, or foot, and whether you want live guidance (&#34;Start navigation&#34;), or only create the route and show it on the map with the (&#34;Display route&#34;) button. </p>
<p>You always can see the distance to the destination point in the top right corner of the map screen, and the direction to your destination via the orange arrow (unless these widgets are disabled).</p>
<p>There is also the option &#34;Navigate from&#34;, if your GPS position is not yet known, or when you want to explore routes from locations other than your own position.</p>
</div>

<div class="subtitle" id="How_To_Use_Voice_Navigation">How to use voice navigation</div>
<div class="content">
  <ul class="list">
  <li> In order to use voice prompts during navigation you first need to download a voice file for the language(s) desired, using the app's download functionality. There are more flexible synthesized (tts, preferred) voice, or recorded voices (which are usually less well maintained).
  <li> All voice data is automatically unzipped onto the SD card under /osmand/voice/xx, where xx denotes the language and voice type. You may have as many voices present as you like.
  <li> Once you have downloaded voices, you can select which one to use under Settings/Navigation/Voice guidance
  <li> The voice will be used after you start any navigation (using "Start navigation", not with just "Display route", of course).
  <li> You can temporarily switch off/on voice prompts via the MENU/Sound on-off option on the map screen
  <li> If you can't find  a voice file for your language, you can help with translation see TranslateHelp.
  <li> There is also an Android application in the Market that enables you to convert voice files to the format OsmAnd uses, but be aware of the possible copyright on these voices.
  </ul>

<p>Note: If you change the TTS language in Osmand, you also need to change the device TTS language in your Android system settings, otherwise you get instructions with e.g. Danish words, pronounced as if it was English text. The exact menu route to change the system TTS language depends on your Android version, so look for &#34;Voice input and output&#34;, then &#34;Text-to-speech settings&#34;.
If your language is not there, you can try the option &#34;Install voice data&#34; in the same menu. For some languages however, you will need to install a third party TSS engine and a language pack. All these Android settings have nothing to do with Osmand, so if you need more info on this part, please see your Android documentation.</p>
</div>

<div class="subtitle" id="How_to_start_the_navigation_from_your_Contacts">How to start the navigation from your Contacts</div>
<div class="content">
<p>You can also navigate from your Contacts. You start this from outside !OsmAnd. Open your Contacts and select the contact of your choice. Click the &#34;google maps&#34; icon, which holds the address data of your Contact (if available).
If you click the &#34;google maps&#34; icon, contacts will ask you for the application to continue the action. Select !OsmAnd. !OsmAnd will start a search for the address and display it on the map with the default grey label enabling you to &#34;Set as destination&#34;, etc.</p>

<div class="subtitle" id="How_To_Avoid_.28or_Limit.29_Internet_Usage">How to avoid (or limit) Internet usage</div>
<div class="content">
<p>OsmAnd by design is optimized to work entirely offline during trips so that e.g. abroad no roaming charges occur. Please consider the follwing preparations before your trips:</p>
  <ol class="list">
  <li> Make sure you have downloaded the offline maps you will need: The native vector maps are stronlgy recommended, see [HowToDownloadData How to Download Data]. In the app, chose "Offline vector maps" as the map source, this is the default anyway unless you had changed it via the Online maps plugin.
  <li> If you have the Online maps plugin enabled , disable "Use internet" for loading online map tiles in (Settings/ Online maps).
  <li> Use OsmAnd (offline) routing under Settings / (use profile) / Navigation. The other online routing engines will of course cause Internet traffic, about 10-30 kBytes per route calculation or each recalculation.
  <li> Know the <b>online functions</b> which do require internet usage, do not use them to avoid internet traffic. They include: </li>
    <ul>
    <li> "Show OSM bugs layer"
    <li> "Update map" (visible in context menu if using Online maps)
    <li> "Create/Edit POI" (but we now have an offline mode for this to upload later)
    <li> "Internet (Nominatim) Search" (use the standard offline Search instead)
    </ul>
  <li> Make sure you double-check all these relevant settings for all use profiles, i.e. transport modes, because some of them can be configured differently per profile!

<div class="subtitle" id="How_to_Record_Your_Movements_in_GPX_Format">How to record your movements in GPX format</div>
<div class="content">
<p>OsmAnd can record your movements in gpx format on your device's internal memory (e.g. SD card). The tracks are saved to folder sdcard/osmand/tracks, named by ISO date and time.</p>

<p>Recording is enabled by default for Car and Bicycle transport modes, not for Walking. To change these settings see <b>Setting up GPX Recording</b> below. The Logging interval is set by default depending on transport mode (Car/Bicycle/Walking) but can be changed (see below).</p>

	<li> Open the !OsmAnd main screen and touch Settings.
	<li> In <b>Settings</b> Menu, <b>Plugins</b> sub menu: Check <b>Logging services & Sleep Mode</b>.</li>
	<li> In <b>Settings</b> Menu, <b>Logging services & Sleep Mode</b> sub menu, set the following for each transport mode (Car/Bicycle/Pedestrian) you want to log:</li>
                <ul>
		<li> Check <b>Log track to GPX file</b> if not already checked.</li>
		<li> Open <b>Logging Interval</b> and select your desired interval (or leave at default). If you are walking, your speed is about 1 m/s so the default 5 second recording interval should be adequate, given the GPS position accuracy of Android devices. This can also be changed in the main screen (see below).</li>
		<li> Open <b>Wake Up Interval</b> and select your desired interval (or leave at default). This can also be changed in the main screen (see below).</li>
		<li> NOTE: This screen also includes <b>Run In Sleep Mode</b> which must be checked for recording but can also be enabled/disabled more conveniently through the main screen (see below).</li>
                </ul>
	<li> Return to the !OsmAnd main screen and go to the map screen.</li>
	<li> The <b>Logging services</b> icon (a satellite dish) is on the left top of the Map screen. This gives access to several logging options.</li>
	<li> If <b>Logging services</b> is showing, skip to the next step. If not, (still in the Map screen):</li>

                </ul>
          </ul>
	<li> Return to the Map screen.</li>
        </ol>

  <div class="blocksubtitle">Recording a GPX Track</div>
        <ol class="list">
	<li> Make sure GPS is switched on.</li>
	<li> In <b>Logging services</b> (a satellite dish, top left of Map screen) tap <b>Record GPX</b> to start recording. Logging interval will be shown and the interval can be changed with a slider. This will record the track, but only while the device is switched on and !OsmAnd is in the foreground. (For sleep mode functionality, see next <b>Recording in Sleep Mode</b> below.)</li>
	<li> Return to the Map screen.</li>
	<li> Verify that recording is active by looking at the GPX recording widget near the top right corner of the map screen. A Red dot indicates recording, with the length of the already recorded track being shown next to it. A Black dot indicates recording is paused.</li>
	<li> To temporarily suspend or toggle recording, open <b>Logging services</b> and tap <b>Stop GPX rec</b> which will have a Red dot above it.</li>
	<li> To save track, open <b>Logging services</b> and tap "Save current gpx track". Tracks will never be lost. If they are not saved manually, they will be saved after the next start of the OsmAnd (even if OsmAnd crashed).</li>
        </ol>

  <div class="blocksubtitle">Recording in Sleep Mode</div>
<p>  In many cases it you will want to record your track in sleep mode, i.e. while the device screen is off. This will conserve battery power while on long hikes etc. </p>
  
<p>  To do this:</p>
        <ol class="list">
	<li> Tap the <b>Logging services</b> icon (top left of Map screen). </li>
	<li> Tap <b>Enable sleep mode</b>. (Record GPX must also be ON). GPS Wake up interval will be shown and the interval can be changed with a slider. This is the time after which the device is repeatedly woken up while the screen is off to get a GPS fix and write a position point (or perform any other pending !OsmAnd action such as sounding a voice prompt for navigation, etc.). The default of 30 seconds is sufficient for hiking. Note that shorter intervals use much more battery power.</li>
        </ol>

  <div class="blocksubtitle">Increasing battery life</div>
  <p><i><b>Hint:</b></i> Before putting the device to sleep mode on a long hike, I always press the home button so the !OsmAnd app goes to the background. If !OsmAnd remains in the foreground, and the device is often turned on even briefly (maybe even accidentally, like by shifting in your pocket or backpack), then GPS would be activated each time with very noticeable impact on you battery life. In remote areas with bad or no cell reception, I also set the device to "Flight mode" (but with GPS on) to save the battery by preventing the cell phone using high transmission power to look for transmission towers. I get a good 20 hours of recording GPX tracks on my hikes with the above parameters.</p>

Just create Google Docs spreadsheet and call it somehow &#39;Location&#39;. Copy key of Google Doc from the browser URL field: key=*0Ana......*. From Spreadsheet call menu &#39;Script Manager...&#39; and add simple script.</p>
<xmp>
 function doGet(e) {
 var app = UiApp.createApplication();

   sp.getRange( "B1").setValue( parseFloat( e.parameter.lon));
   sp.getRange( "F1").setValue( Math.round(( parseFloat( e.parameter.speed / 1000 * 60 *60))) + " km/h");
   sp.getRange( "D1").setValue( parseFloat( e.parameter.altitude));

<p>There is no full support now for public transport routing in the OsmAnd application, however there is a transport search that can help you in some situations. First of all the start point of search is the last visible map center &#38; the end point is point navigate to (red circle). The transport you are searching has a radius specified by &#34;find more&#34; button. If there is no selected routes you will see only one item (selecting route for distance). </p>
<p>If you find/select any route you should select stop to imitate you are getting out. ! The routes are sorted in way to minimize way by food ! The closest stop is marked as ! The search tries to find the best direct way for you. Once you select stop to get out, you can continue search after that stop by selecting search after or finish search. After that you will see route is selected and &#34;searching route&#34; goes down. After that you can repeat procedure or go back to previous results by selecting one route or deleting it. When you select finish route you will see more detailed information about the whole route.</p>

<p>If you often navigate to some places you can manage them as favorite places. Just pressing on map long click and add them to favorite. You can also use them to measure distance from map center. Some of favorite places could change location like a car, for that case you can use option for adding favorite/replace existing. So you will always track where is your car, even if map is not available.</p>
<p>Note: There are several categories for your favorites. You can simply add your favorite to a new category by typing a new category name when saving a favorite.</p>

<div class="subtitle" id="How_To_Use_POI_Filters_for_searching">How to use POI filters for searching</div>
<div class="content">
<p>OsmAnd comes with a lot of POIs. The top set of POI categories (circle with star in it) are predefined filters. The set below (folder icons) are the POIs as such per category.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the predefined OSM types of (filtered) POIs, you can create your own Custom Filters on the POI search screen. The first time you select Custom Filter you can select the whole top level categories (press the check boxes) or subcategories (long-pressing on label of type). A custom filter is not saved between sessions, but you can use it for fast repetitive filtering. To save your filter, you need to (in filter edit mode) select MENU, then &#34;Save as&#34;, and enter a name for the custom filter. After that it will be displayed on search POI screen. Long-pressing any existing filter will go to the filter edit mode, short-pressing one will use the filter selected.</p>
<p>Note: When long-pressing a predefined POI filter, you can see what is in it and modify the filter if necessary and use a &#34;Save as&#34; to create a derived filter based on the one you just edited.</p>

  <li> Contour line data and Hillshade overlays can be downloaded via OsmAnd's "Settings/Data Management", please note the selector in the top left corner of the Download screen. Regular maps, Hillshade overlays and Contour line data are 3 different types of download(!)</li>

  <li> See below how to display in our regular offline maps. You can, of course, have Contour lines and Hillshades in parallel on the same map.</li>
  </ul>
<div class="blocksubtitle" id="1._Contour_lines:">Contour lines</div>

    </ul>
<div class="blocksubtitle" id="2._Hillshade_overlay:">Hillshade overlay</div>
<p>  This overlay is technically different (it is a tile map).</p>
  <p>In Osmand release version 1.1.2 and 1.1.3</p>
    <ul class="list">
    <li> you need the "Online maps" internal plugin activated,
    <li> then from the map screen you need to select Menu / Map Overlay... then select EXACTLY the correct Hillshade file for your region (needs changing when moving between regions).
    <li> You also need to select a transparency value (This can be done in the online map Settings. I suggest "100" and made this the app's default). The numeric value can only be seen via the Settings / Online maps / Overlay transparency, not with the on-screen selector. On the map screen, you can hide the transparency selector via the red cross.
    </ul>

   <p>UPDATE 2013-04-07: In the latest nightly builds (or release versions >1.1.3)</p>
     <ul class="list">
     <li> a direct "Hillshade layer" toggle is now included under "(Map screen)/Menu-Button/Configure Screen" to display or hide the correct hillshade data file for all locations (if present on the device), with the correct transparency, and without the need to have the Advanced settings or the Online maps plugin enabled (Countour lines plugin still required).

<div class="subtitle" id="Planning_Plugin">Planning/Measurement plugin</div>
<div class="content">
<p>Planning/Measurement plugin provides three additional features to the standard OsmAnd Android application:</p>
  <ol class="list">
  <li> The ability to Measure the distance between two or more points on the map.</li>

  <li> The ability to place a series of randomly selected points on the map that represent a planned path to follow, either immediately or at some time in the future.</li>

  <li> The ability to magnify the current map display to make it easier to read.</li>
  </ol>

<div class="blocksubtitle">Measurement function</div>

<p>This is useful to get quick estimates of point-to-point distances using two or more points, or for more detailed distance calculations using any number of points to describe the path to be measured.</p>

<div class="blocksubtitle">Creating, saving and loading planning tracks</div>

<p>Planning Tracks (a sequence of points) can be manually created over the map then saved, and subsequently (re-)loaded. These tracks can be used to capture a planned path to follow, for such activities as sightseeing, hiking, planned travels (e.g. holidays), etc. Tracks can be simply edited by dragging individual points to new locations or by inserting additional points. When making travel plans, several different versions can be saved for later consideration or comparison.</p>

<div class="blocksubtitle">Display zoom function</div>

<p>This is particularly useful when using a high resolution display with raster maps (e.g. Google maps) that can have text that is too small to read easily (e.g. when driving), as they were designed for use on larger computer displays. Display zooming is different to map zooming, which determines how much of the worlds surface is displayed on the unmagnified map. As more area is included in the map, the amount of detail is reduced to keep the map legible. Display zooming is like using a magnifying glass: it merely magnifies what is on the map but it does not change the area covered or the amount of detail included. Display zooming works for all map types.</p>

<div class="blocksubtitle">Basic operation</div>
  <ul class="list">
  <li> The Planning/Measurement plugin can be turned on/off from the Main Menu / Plugin Manager. When turned off, the screen display zoom feature and all the plugin-specific menu options are not available. The following assumes that the Planning/Measurement plugin has been enabled:</li>

  <li> Planning/Measurement mode can be turned on/off using the Planning/Measurement control button at the upper right of the screen.</li>

  <li> Create a new track of points using long touches at the desired locations.</li>

  <li> When Planning/Measurement mode is enabled, the cumulative distance between points created on the map is displayed. When turned off, the points and associate information text boxes are hidden but not deleted.</li>

  <li> Points can be dragged to a new location and the location and distance information will automatically be adjusted.</li>

  <li> Points can be inserted before any existing point by tapping on the point and selecting the "Insert point before this" option from the pop-up menu. Long touch anywhere on the map to insert the new point.</li>

  <li> To save a planning track, tap on the Planning/Measurement control button at the upper right of the screen. This will open a menu giving the option to save the track as a plan-specific GPX file. The saved file will be the same as any standard GPX file but will have "plan_" added as a prefix to the file name.</li>

  <li> Saved planning .gpx files can be reloaded, edited and re-saved as often as required.</li>

  <li> GPX Files that do not have the "plan_" prefix (e.g. daily saved GPS tracks) will not load as an editable track.</li>

  <li> Tap on any point or its associated information text box to open a menu that provides options, including the amount of information displayed.</li>

  <li> The displayed size of the points and the size of the screen area around the point that can be used to select the point are independently adjustable using the menu options accessed using the Planning/Measurement control button at the upper right of the screen. The selection size will automatically be kept at least as big as the display size.</li>

  <li> Various other display and control functions are available via the various menus displayed after tapping a point, its information text box or the Planning/Measurement control button at the upper right of the screen. These include:</li>
   <ol type="a">
   <li>Removing the selected point.</li>

   <li>Removing all points.</li>

   <li>A basic Help screen </li>
   </ol>
  </ul>
<p>Note that turning off Planning/Measurement mode does not remove the track created or any points. </p>
  <ul class="list">
  <li> Display zooming can be controlled using the + and - buttons on the left side of the screen. These buttons can be hidden using the Planning/Measurement control button menu. The current display zoom selected will remain in effect.
  </ul>

<p>The plugin is a beta version and has been published on this site for test and evaluation purposes. It will be incorporated into the product range after it has been formally approved for distribution.</p>

<div class="content">
  <ol class="list">
  <li> In order to create your own Vector Maps (if needed, please be aware of the pre-fabricated global country maps!), please use OsmAndMapCreator. As the source data you will need an .osm vector file, or osm.bz2, or .pbf. You can e.g. download these OSM files from Geofabrik. You can create an OsmAnd vector map from the whole file or for selected area only (File menu). Before converting the file you can use the checkboxes to select in what kind of indexes you are interested in in order to save application memory. After loading just press generating indexes, wait some hours, and transfer the .obf file to the sdcard of your device in the folder osmand.
  <li> You can also convert your own maps from different formats (.shp ESRI shape files, .mp Polish format and other GIS formats) to .osm files and then convert them with OsmAndMapTileCreator. There are a lot of ways to get your files in .osm format. One popular way to do that is by converting them first to Google KML format. A good tool to get KML format is QGIS or QantumGis. If you have the .KML file you can use GPS Babel to make .osm files. You can convert POI's in this way, but also complete vector maps with (poly)lines, points and polygons or area's. See also [CreatingKMLFile Using KML Files].
  <li> See also [CustomizeOBFFileContent Creating Customized Vector Data]
  <li> You can prepare a raster map database in .sqlite format using OsmAndMapCreator from Downloads. You can put a lot of map types in this format, like Google Maps, OSM. Using OsmAndMapTileCreator: Select an area by left dragging, choose the map source, click preload tiles and select the zoom levels you want to preload. The tiles/indexes will be saved in working directory that is visible at the application status bar. After that, click Menu, Source of tiles, Create sqlite database. Now you have 1 compact file where all the downloaded images are stored. Transfer it to your device into the osmand\tiles folder. To display tile maps in OsmAnd, please enbale the Online maps plugin. With menu option: Source of tiles > User Defined, you can also view popular online tile maps from the internet.
  <li> You can prepare map tiles using TrekBuddyAtlasCreator saving to Maverick format. As always, storing tile maps takes a lot of space compared to vector maps.

<p>Remark: These were the original &#34;static&#34; zoom limits, before we expanded the rendering scheme below zoom 7 and created an algorithm to already &#34;selectively&#34; include significant map objects there at map creation time.</p>

<div class="blocksubsubtitle" id="A_note_on_map_dependability">A note on map dependability</div>
<p>Regarding zoom level 12:* Most people use maps in a sense to &#34;find out where they can go&#34; (like travelers finding out how to get to certain places, where you can hike, etc.). This implies that there MUST exist some high enough (overview) zoom level (I use 12 in Touring view) on which you see ALL ways to move on (highways, tracks, paths etc.). It cannot be that you miss a way you could take, because it is too low in classification (e.g. only an unclassified road) and would only have been displayed zooming in further (to a scale you do not go to because you do not have the overview any more without a lot of scrolling of where this road goes and what it connects).</p>


<p>A major idea still to be implemented is this:* OSM data contains a lot of detail, which can very much &#34;clutter&#34; a map display in dense and in OSM well-maintained areas like European city centers. But OSM data can also be life-saving in areas with only very few mapped features, like in deserts, where most of the infrastructure may be &#34;empty space&#34;, but the occasional tracks, paths, and springs/tanks become of high importance.</p>

<p>While we certainly cannot display every track and hiking trail in a city at zoom 10, we should develop a way to (sort of dynamically, depending on how many OSM features are displayed on a certain typical screen size) *display present OSM features in map sections where we would otherwise only show very little or no features (&#34;Avoid empty map ziles where we have data!&#34;)*. This could be life saving, vital detail in these &#34;empty&#34; areas must not only be detectable with a lot of trial-and-error scrolling in all screen directions.</p>
<p>Example: You should in &#34;feature-empty&#34; map places (typical screen size has few OSM features displayed) be able to spot e.g. tracks at zoom 10, which otherwise would only be displayed at zoom 12 and could only be &#34;discovered&#34; with a lot of scrolling.

<p>I will also post this basic rendering conept and dynamic enhancement idea (with a few screenshots) to the OSM community and offer my assistance, because I think it is a major shortcoming of the Mapnik renderer currently used on their openstreetmap.org web site, blocking overall higher popularity (and use) of OSM maps.</p>

<p>In Touring view:</p>
  <ul class="list">
  <li> some road and track types already rendered at lower zooms (for travel and orienteering)
  <li> the road colors allow unambiguous distinction between all highway/road/track types 
  <li> the road colors are more aligned with conventional road atlas
  <li> the road visibility is increased for better outdoor, driving, and navigation use
  <li> the route+gpx visibility increased
  <li> there are additional touring feature options
    <ul>
    <li> to display the SAC scale (for Alpine hiking)
    <li> display hiking route symbols
    <li> display bicycle networks
    </ul>

<p><i>(by Christof Knuesel, 18.10.2012,  based on default renderer by Hardy Mueller)</i></p>
<div class="blocksubtitle"> Purpose</div>
<p>Alpine Hiking option for mountain hiking with "Hike Bike Map (Hills Underlay)" as overlay map: With "Hike Bike Map (Hills Underlay)" it becomes hard to distinguish between black lines (path) and brown lines (track). For this reason tracks are rendered with higher strokewidth than paths, respectively as solid lines (all tracktypes), while paths are rendered as dashed lines (Alpine Hiking Mode).</p>
<p>Roads: German map style</p>

    <li> red dashed line: sac_scale = demanding_mountain_hiking
    <li> blue solid line: sac_scale = alpine_hiking
    <li> blue dashed line: sac_scale = demanding_alpine_hiking
    <li> blue dotted line: sac_scale = difficult_alpine_hiking
    </ul>
<p>Tracks (all tracktypes) are rendered as brown solid lines</p>

<div class="blocksubsubtitle" id="3.2.2_Other_Modes">Other Modes</div>

    <li> short dashed line (tracktype = grade3, short dashed narrow-spaced: tracktype not specified)
    <li> dash-dotted line (tracktype = grade4)
    <li> dotted line (tracktype = grade5)
