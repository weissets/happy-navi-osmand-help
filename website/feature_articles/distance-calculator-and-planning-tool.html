<p>If you just want to measure the distance between two or more points, hit the widget in the upper right corner of the map and choose Start editing. You can add point to the map by tapping on it. You&#39;ll see the orange line between the waypoints - that&#39;s the distance calculated. Please note that it is not a route, it does not take streets and other objects to account. It is the same as a simple ruler: you measure the shortest distance between two points. If you can't see the widget, please reload the application.</p>
<p>When you'll add the second point to your measurements, you'll see the distance between them in the widget. As you add other points, you'll see the entire length of the line.</p>

<p>You can also export the points you&#39;ve added as a GPX file. Just tap the widget once you add all the points, then choose Save as GPX track and name it. You&#39;ll see your new track in the Tracks list at the dashboard. To view it, simply tap on the track and choose Show on map. To see the information about the waypoint including the speed at a certain point, just make a long tap on the waypoint.</p>
<p>You can also choose Open existing GPX to edit a GPX track. You can use the track any way you want: plan your trip, share it or export it to Open Street Map project. Just go to Dashboard - My tracks and tap Share.</p>
