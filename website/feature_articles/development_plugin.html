<p>OsmAnd development plugin is only necessary for developers. It allows you to simulate navigation routes, check screen rendering performance, etc.</p>
<p>If you need to check how the routes are built, how voice guidance works, etc, you need to go to the dashboard, find Simulate your position card and tap Start simulation. You'll be able to either build a new route by selecting Simulate using calculated route or use a GPX track for that.</p>
<p>To simulate a navigation route, you'll need to calculate a route first and then use this option.</p>
<p>If you select the GPX variant, you'll be able to pick the speed and then the track to follow.</p>
