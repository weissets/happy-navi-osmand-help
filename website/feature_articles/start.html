<p>When you launch OsmAnd for the first time, all the parameters will be set to default settings. You can configure them by changing features in the menu. As you launch the app, you'll see the dashboard - a  starting screen with different cards containing information about different groups of settings or files. The dashboard shows your Favourites (favourite places), your GPX tracks list, the plugins information, etc.</p>

<p>Also, you have to download a World basemap. It is a basic map that will later help you view the maps of the regions and countries.
The free version of OsmAnd allows 10 free downloads. After the map is downloaded, please tap the 'back' button to go to the map screen.</p>
<p>The OsmAnd+ version allows unlimited downloads and map updates with all the new details. The application uses Open Street Map resources - the maps created by contributors from all over the world. People add new items to the map, refine the details and delete the points of interest (POI) that are no longer there. Thus, the updates will provide the freshest information available.
To download the map of the region you need, go to Settings - Manage map files - All downloads and choose the one you need.</p>

<p>Units of measure: Select kilometres/metres, miles/feet, or miles/yards as desired. This affects all distance and speed displays and announcements. You can also change this later in Settings - General Settings - Driving region and Settings - General Settings - Units of measure.</p>

<b>Android</b>
<p>There are several ways to view maps. For offline use, you need to pre-download your maps. The OsmAnd native format is a compact vector .obf format.</p>
<p>There are two main types of maps you can download.</p>
<p><b>Vector maps (preferred solution)</b></p>
<p>You can download pre-fabricated "vector" maps in OsmAnd's native format. They are very compact (about 10% compared to tiles) and allow zooming in to very high zoom levels without losing detail or resolution. If you have a relatively slower device, please note that zooming out to "overview" levels usually takes more time and CPU.</p>
<p>To download the maps you need, just go to Settings - Manage map files and select the one you need. The free OsmAnd version has the limit of 10 downloads (including additional voice prompts, etc.) while OsmAnd+ allows an unlimited number of downloads.</p>
<p><b>Prepared maps</b></p>
<p>Also, you can make your own maps using  <a href="http://download.osmand.net/latest-night-build/OsmAndMapCreator-main.zip">OsmAnd Maps Creator</a>, a tool designed for this purpose. You'll need to prepare the maps on your PC and them to the OsmAnd folder on your device. You might need to restart the app then.</p>
<b>iOS</b>
<p>As you install OsmAnd iOS application, you'll be able to view and manage offline maps of virtually any country of the world. To do so, you need to tap the menu button on the left, then select Maps & Resources, choose the continent and then proceed to the map download. You can also use the Search field to find the necessary map. Besides the general map itself, you'll see a contour lines map, a Wikipedia file, a hillshade map, etc. They can be downloaded together with the main map to add layers of information. If the downloads are inactive, you'll need to turn on the contour lines plugin first. Tap Plugins menu and switch it on. To download the map, just tap the download button next to it. As soon as the map is downloaded, tap Go to the map and start viewing the map you need. You can also start downloading other maps and view the one that's already installed while the download is in progress. Just go to the map by tapping Back.</p>

<p>If you select a tts voice, you need to have a respective text-to-speech engine in your Android operating system. These are partly included in Android or can be installed separately. Please go to your Android (device) settings, find Language and keyboard / Text-to-speech output or similar. Select or install an engine, then also install the language support for the language you need, this may be an extra setting or small download.</p>
<p>Please test ('Listen to an example' or similar test button provided) if your Android tts is working ok. Then you may also test if your OsmAnd voice prompts have been selected properly by going to Settings &#8212; General &#8212; OsmAnd development &#8212; Test voice prompts in OsmAnd. (OsmAnd debugging plugin must be activated to see the setting).</p>
