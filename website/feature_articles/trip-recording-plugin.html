<p>OsmAnd Trip recording plugin is an essential tool for runners, sportsmen and tourists. It allows you to record your movement using your phone&#39;s GPS (and through other networks optionally). If you are going for a run, need to see your entire route after a walk around the city or measure the distance you covered, the plugin will help you.</p>

<b>Android</b>
<p>You have to enter the Plugins menu, then select Trip recording and tap Enable. That&#39;s pretty much it. To start recording, you need to tap on the GPX widget in the right upper corner of the map screen. Also, you can choose the logging interval which determines the time between recording moments in your track. The plugin is now working. You can start your trip and see the distance you&#39;ve walked in the specific widget on the right.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also an opportunity to add new waypoints to the track manually. Just tap on the location on map, choose Add GPX waypoint, name it the way you want. Then go to My Tracks dashboard menu and hit the save button. Your waypoint is added to the most recent track automatically.</p>

<b>iOS</b>
<p>To get the plugin, just go to Maps &#38; Resources - Plugins - Trip recording. Then tap the checkbox next to it. That's it.
Just tap the widget on the map screen to start recording, set the recording interval and start your trip. When done, just tap the widget again. You can also start a new segment or view track info in the same menu.</p>

<div class="subtitle" id="How_to_view_GPX_tracks"><h2>How to view GPX tracks</h2></div>
<b>Android</b>
<p>You can view your GPX tracks in OsmAnd or in other software. Also, the track itself can be created by you or imported from an external source. For instance, from <a href="http://openstreetmap.org"> openstreetmap.org</a>, your local hiking forum or any other place.</p>
<p>To view it in OsmAnd, go to the Dashboard  - My tracks and tap 'Show on map' on those you'd like to see.</p>
<p>To view it in Google Earth, go to File > Open > file type GPS (*.gpx, . . .) Navigate to your track and open.</p>
<p><b>View OsmAnd GPX tracks in Garmin software</b></p>
<p>Because OsmAnd GPX format differs from the Garmin one, you will need to convert your OsmAnd track into the Garmin format.</p>
<p>Download and install GPSBabel from gpsbabel.org</p>
<p>To be safe, make a copy of the GPX file to work with.</p>
<p>Open GPSBabel and use the following settings:</p>
<ul class="textlist">
        <li>Input format: "GPX XML"</li>
        <li>Source file: Copied file as discussed above</li>
        <li>Output format: "Garmin MapSource - gdb"</li>
        <li>Output file same name as input file (i.e. overwrite source - Answer Yes when prompted to over-write)</li>
    <li>Run GPSBabel ("Apply" button). If the translation has worked the log screen will say "Translation successful"</li>
</ul>
<p>Open the converted file in Garmin software (!MapSource, !BaseCamp) in your usual way.</p>
<p><b>View (and edit/convert) OsmAnd GPX tracks in RouteConverter</p></b>

<p>Download RouteConverter from <a href="https://routeconverter.de">routeconverter.de</a>.</p>
<p>RouteConverter can edit and convert GPX tracks and tracks from many other formats. It can be used to create a route and save that as a GPX track, as well.</p>
<p>You can also save your every navigation trip as a GPX track automatically. To do that, go to Settings - Plugins - Trip recording - Settings and choose Log track to GPX file during navigation. After you do that, your every navigation trip will be saved as a GPX track in the tracks folder.</p>
<p>Take OsmAnd Trip recording plugin with you on your trip to make an informative track.</p>
<b>CAUTION</b> Recording a track impacts the battery life: even if the screen is off, it continues to run. Check it using the notification that OsmAnd is running in the background in your status bar. 
<p>Increasing battery life</p>
<p>Hint: Before putting the device to sleep mode on a long hike, press the home button so the OsmAnd app goes to the background. If OsmAnd remains in the foreground and the device is often turned on even briefly (maybe even accidentally, like by shifting in your pocket or backpack), then GPS would be activated each time with very noticeable impact on you battery life. In remote areas with bad or no cell reception, you can also set the device to "Flight mode" (but with GPS on) to save the battery by preventing the cell phone using high transmission power to look for transmission towers. You can get good 20 hours of recording GPX tracks on hikes with the above parameters.</p>
<div class="subtitle" id="Online_tracking"><h2>Online tracking</h2></div>
<b>Android</b>
<p>You can set up your phone to track its location. T do that, go to Settings - Plugins - Trip recording and tap Settings, then choose Online Tracking. To make it possible, you also have to provide a valid link.</p>
<p>Make a Google Spreadsheet and name it. Then go to Tools - Scrip Editor - Create script for  - Blank project. In your spreadsheet, copy the key from the URL field. It is a set of numbers like this: </p>
<p>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<b>1ev_1UaENcl7ukWsE-tnO6ixVxFdn0OlNhTHKAHUHjEg</b>/edit#gid=0</p>
<p>Go back to the script.</p>
<p>Delete everything. Insert this code:</p>
<font size="2">This is some text!<p>function doGet(e) {</p>
<p>var app = UiApp.createApplication();</p>
<p>var sp = SpreadsheetApp.openById("0Ana......");</p>
<p>sp.insertRowBefore(1);</p>
<p>if(e) {</p>
<p>var d = new Date( Date( e.parameter.timestamp));</p>
<p>sp.getRange( "A1").setValue( parseFloat( e.parameter.lat));</p>
<p>sp.getRange( "B1").setValue( parseFloat( e.parameter.lon));</p>
<p> sp.getRange( "F1").setValue( Math.round(( parseFloat( e.parameter.speed / 1000 * 60 *60))) + " km/h");</p>
<p>sp.getRange( "D1").setValue( parseFloat( e.parameter.altitude));</p>
<p>sp.getRange( "E1").setValue( parseFloat( e.parameter.hdop));</p>
<p>sp.getRange( "C1").setValue( d);</p>
<p> }</p>
<p>return app;</p>
<p> } </font></p>
<p>Paste your Spreadsheet key instead of <b>0Ana......</b></p>
<p>Save and go to Publish - Deploy as web app - set access as Anyone, even anonymous.</p>
<p>Now your movements will be exported to that spreadsheet as coordinates. You'll find speed information in the document. You can also set tracking interval.</p>
<p>Setup own server: because Google deprecates lots of stuff, please think of own server <a href="http://www.heise.de/ct/projekte/machmit/mylieu/browser/Server">machmit/mylieu/browser/Server ksmapper.blogspot.co.at</a> or end to end solution like <a href="http://osmodroid.ru/">http://osmodroid.ru/</a></p>
