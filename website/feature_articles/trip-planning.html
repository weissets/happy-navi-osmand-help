<div class="subtitle" id="Planning_your_trip_with_Navigation_option"><h2>Planning your trip with Navigation option</h2></div>
<p>You can create a new route using the Navigation option of the app. This tool is designed to help you find an optimal route according to your vehicle, personal requirements, etc. You can choose a car, bicycle or pedestrian mode, choose to avoid certain types of roads, etc. As soon as the route is build, you'll get a turn-by-turn voice guidance.
If you'd like to save the track of your movement, just turn the Trip recording plugin on and start a new GPX track before you proceed.</p>

<div class="blocksubtitle">Android</div>
<p>You can join your favorites into a route. This is especially handy on vacations and trips to new places: add the points you'd like to visit to Favorites and then build a route covering them all. To do that, just go to your Favorites list by tapping Show All next to Favorites in the Dashboard. Then tap the flag icon on the bottom. Now you can choose the locations to visit. After that, tap the flag icon once again. You'll be able to order the points by the way they are sorted on your Favorites list or use the Door-by-door option. This option arranges the points to make the most comfortable route. For instance, you can start with your waypoint number 2, then four, then five, etc. if they are located closer to each other. You can also add waypoints after the route is calculated. Just tap on the map and choose Add as waypoint. You'll be able to arange the waypoints after that. Choose your starting point in the navigation menu. You can start the route from your current position, a Favorite on the map,  the point on map you select or a particular address.</p>

<p>To add your favorites as waypoints, you'll need to go to My trips - Create new trip, and then tap the Favorites manually to add them as waypoints. Then press Save.</p>
<div class="subtitle" id="Trip_planning_iOS"><h2>Trip planning for iOS</h2></div>
<p>OsmAnd for iOS has a trip planning option. It allows you to save your waypoints and view their location. To create a new trip, enter the My trips menu, choose Create new trip and then add waypoints by making long taps. You can also add details to the waypoint, such as its name, color indicating this waypoint, its group (you can create a group of waypoints: work locations, favorite spots on town, etc.) and a description. Then hit Save. You'll be able to view your saved trip in Settings - My trips.</p>
<p>Try the route management menu to sort the points. Tap the blue toolbar, then swipe the waypoint you'd like to move higher on the list and tap the arrow icon. You can also activate or deactivate waypoints to customize your route in this menu. Add an endless number of waypoints.</p>

<p>You'll see the added waypoints in a toolbar on the top of the screen. Now you can view waypoints or delete them by tapping on the upper toolbar and swiping to the left. Tap the arrow to unfold the full list and choose the point you need to get to in order to see the distance to it and view the location on map. Please note that the points are connected by straight lines and are meant to help you create a general understanding of the directions for your trip. Hit the arrow button to start following the directions. To mark a waypoint as visited, select the checkbox sign. Same checkboxes will be available as soon as you approach the waypoints.</p>
