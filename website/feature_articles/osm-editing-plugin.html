<p>OSM Editing plugin allows you to make contributions to OpenStreetMap,  a global community aimed at creating a comprehensive map of the world and providing up-to date open-source data to every user.</p>
<p>Just launch OsmAnd Maps &#38; Navigation app and send the information about different locations.</p>
<div class="subtitle" id="How_to_use_it"><h2>How to use it</h2></div>
<p>The plugin lets you create new objects, so-called points of interest or POI on the map. New shop opened next to you? Add it on the map! Your favorite monument is missing on the map? Put it there in seconds. Also, if you&#39;re the owner of a newly-opened business, adding it on the map is a great way to let people find you.</p>
<p>So how to do it? Enable the plugin in Settings - Plugins. Tap on the map where the new POI has to be placed. Then choose Create POI, add its name and other details like working hours, website, etc. You&#39;ll also have to register at <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.com">openstreetmap.com</a> and then provide your OSM credentials to introduce changes.</p>

<p>You can add the tracks you&#39;ve made to Open Street Map. To do that, turn the Trip recording plugin on, make a track, and then go to My tracks - Show all, pick the one you want to add to the map and tap Export. Your track will be added to <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/traces">http://www.openstreetmap.org/traces</a>, you can view it and other users can find it helpful, as well. You can participate in the work on the global map. Just share the tracks you've made. They become part of the OpenStreetMap project. Make sure you tag objects and roads.</p>
