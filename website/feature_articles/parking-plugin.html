<b>Android</b>
<p>To use the plugin, simply tap and hold a spot on the map where your car is, then set it as a Parking spot and add a reminder if you'd like to get one. If you choose to get one, identify the length of your planned parking. When the times goes up, you'll get notified to go back and get your car. Also, check how far your parking spot is with a simple widget in the right upper corner of the screen.</p>

<b>iOS</b>
<p>To activate the Parking plugin in iOS, you need to go to Maps & Recourses menu, then tap the plugin button and turn the plugin on. Now go back to the map. Make a long tap on the spot where your car is. You can use the location finder by tapping the 'target button' on the right first. Then you'll see a menu in the bottom: use Add Parking option on the right. You can choose parking with unlimited time or with the limited one. If you select the second one, the app will add an event to your calendar saying 'Pickup the car'. You'll normally get a reminder when the time runs out and will be able to view, close or snooze it.</p>

<p>Please note that the reminders are often set to appear 5 minutes before the event, so if you set the parking time limit to less than 5 minutes, you might not get a reminder.</p>
<p>You'll see the parking marker on the map as well, so if you need to return to the parking spot, just tap the destination bar on the top and the map will show you the parking place.</p>
<p>OsmAnd Parking is a simple yet handy tool helping you with parking, especially at new locations.</p>
