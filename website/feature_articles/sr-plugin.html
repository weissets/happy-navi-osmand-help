<p>The Stress Reduction Plugin uses crowdsourcing for better routes with less stress. You can help to improve future navigation by telling us how you feel on the go.</p>
<p>In order to determine the perceived quality of your ride on certain road sections, your cooperation is appreciated! </p>

	<h2>How to use it</h2>
</div>
<p>Each time you stop your car you can evaluate the last traveled road sections.</p>
<div class="imgcontainer"><img class="screenshot" src="images/features/sr_dialog_en.png" /></div>
<p>Please give a rating for the last traveled road sections:
	<ul>
		<li>Green smiley: everything was fine</li>
		<li>Yellow smiley: the stress and tiring factor of the roads was medium</li>
		<li>Red smiley: the stress and tiring factor of the roads was high</li>
	</ul>

<p><strong>With each review you help to improve the route calculation for future trips! </strong></p>
