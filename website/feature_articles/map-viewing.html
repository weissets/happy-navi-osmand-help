<p>OsmAnd gives you great possibilities for using the maps. You can customize them, download different types of maps and even edit them!</p>
<p>We recommend you download the World basemap before proceeding. You can then move on to downloading the map of your region or the one you're planning to travel to. OsmAnd uses the Open Street Maps, the maps made by the open-source project, a community of volunteer contributors who work on the maps every day.
This is why they are so up-to-date. They&#39;re also quite compact and rapidly rendered as the basic OsmAnd map is a vector-type map, which means it carries vector representation of the map details rendered together on your device as opposed to the tile or raster maps that are&#39;pictures&#39;.</p>

To switch the mode, please go to Configure map - Day/Night map. There are two more modes in this menu: Sunrise/sunset and Light sensor. 
The day mode is set by default: it is your OsmAnd map the way you see it when you launch the application.The Sunrise/Sunset mode changes the color scheme automatically based on the time set on your device.
The Light sensor option turns the night and day mode based on the lighting in your environment.
Light sensor option works on phones that have a light sensor on the front. When you get to a dark place, be it a night outdoors or a dark room, the app will switch to the night map viewing mode. As you get to a lighted area, it'll change the map viewing mode to Day.</p>
